# Challenge 6

This challenge asks you to print out all values in the large data set within a provided range. Because this is a large data set, you will also need to be able to arrive at the solution as efficiently as possible. The following are some requirements for this challenge:

- You may assume the data set is an ascending-ordered list of numbers
- You may use any search algorithm you are comfortable with
- Your solution must find a result within 1.25 milliseconds, otherwise the test will not pass
- Your solution must be provided in [src/solution.py], under the `find_range` function

### Running your code

As there is a strict time requirement, you should run [src/test.py] to determine whether your solution is correct. You will not need to figure out how to read the input, as that will be taken care of by the test. You are free to test your implementation in isolation, but your solution will only be valid if it passes the tests.
