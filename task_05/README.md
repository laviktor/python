# Challenge 5

This challenge is the same as challenge 2, but this time, you need to respect the order of operations. You may reuse logic from that challenge to get you started for this, but solving this challenge will require a slightly different approach. Like with the previous challenge, all operations are expected to be integer operations (e.g., division will always return a whole number).

For this challenge, we will assume the following:
- Only the following mathematical operations will be used: +, -, *, /
- Numbers and operators will be separated by a single space
- A line may end with a line break character (\n), in which case another set of operations will follow
- No other values will be present

## Expected skills

You are expected to utilize the following skills for this task:
- Reading files
- String processing
- Recursive functions

## Sample input

```
2 + 1
1 + 2 + 3
2 + 2 * 2 - 2
55 - 6 * 3 * 2
55 / 10 + 10 / 5
```

## Sample output

```
3
6
4
19
7
```
