# Challenge 2

The goal of this challenge is to calculate the value of a given set of operations. You will need to read an input file that contains one or more lines containing mathematical operations to carry out. For each line in the input, you will need to output the final value of the operation. All operations are expected to be integer operations (e.g., division will always return a whole number). For this challenge, the order of operations does not need to be respected.

For this challenge, we will assume the following:
- Only the following mathematical operations will be used: +, -, *, /
- Numbers and operators will be separated by a single space
- A line may end with a line break character (\n), in which case another set of operations will follow
- No other values will be present

## Expected skills

You are expected to utilize the following skills for this task:
- Reading files
- String processing
- Loops

## Sample input

```
2 + 1
1 + 2 + 3
2 + 2 * 2 - 2
55 - 6 * 3 * 2
55 / 10 + 10 / 5
```

## Sample output

```
3
6
6
294
3
```
